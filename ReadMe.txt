Programming Component: Sentiment Detector

To run the Sentiment Detector, compile and run the 'BilalAyoub3190Project.java' file.
This can be done by typing the following two commands into a Terminal:
javac BilalAyoub3190Project.java
java BilalAyoub3190Project

The first command compiles the Java file while the second runs it.
This program has been tested on the University of Manitoba's Mac machines.

To use the Sentiment Detector once it's up and running:
- input any text and press Enter
- the program will print out a list of possible emotions your text may be displaying
- you can then keep entering text until you tire of testing out the program
- at this point, you can type "quit", followed by pressing Enter and the program will end.
